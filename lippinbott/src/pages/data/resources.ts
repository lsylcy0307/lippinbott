Includes dictionaries, encyclopedias, handbooks, guides to the literature, bibliographies, finding books, using indexes, annual reviews, style guides, and other resources. Overview Getting Started Books Journals and Articles Research Tools Statistics, Data, & Mapping Dissertations Doctoral dissertations are book-length works of original research. (Some dissertations, typically in economics and demography, are collections of article-length research reports.) Dissertations are particularly useful for several reasons: They may cover current events, or they may address very recent scholarship practices, more quickly than journal articles or books.

The population returns are published alongside education reports, while grants of land reveal who held the colonial wealth. Imports and exports are joined by prison records which reveal what the crimes were at that time. As these records are published together, the reader can compare the living conditions and access to services across colonies.

It also attempts to contextualize research impact analysis by bringing in alternative assessment suggestions, pointing out metric limitations, and presenting counterpoints. Compile Departmental Publications Research centers, departments, and working groups often compile annual lists of new publications. Rather than surveying faculty or trying to piece together limited information, use Affiliation fields and saved author lists in databases to ease this process. Curate Researcher Publications Researchers are often asked to maintain a list of professional publications. Simplify this process by setting up an ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) iD and linking it to an author profile in major databases. Discover Potential Collaborators Research can be complex and interdisciplinary, and at a large institution like Penn, it's possible to find multiple scholars interested in the same subject, but situated in very different contexts and departments. Try the Scopus Researcher Discovery tool to find potential Penn collaborators by topic. Compare Journals Rather than compiling journal metrics one at a time, use Journal Citation Reports to compare up to 50 journals at a time across various metrics, including Journal Impact Factor (JIF). This page also details the downside of relying on journal metrics and offers alternatives. Explore a Document's Impact Consider all the ways a single document may have impact: through scholarship, policy, newsworthy discussion, and more. This page discusses challenges with assessing a document's impact and walks through finding metrics and altmetrics. Calculate H-Index H-index is a metric related to author productivity and citation statistics. This page offers two tools to gather a researcher's h-index, and walks through how to manually reconcile differences if necessary.

While we already provide access to bioinformatics-specific books, e-books and journals, and there are several Research Cores (e.g. BIC, ITMAT) that support high-end bioinformatics needs, at the Holman Biotech Commons's our focus is on filling gaps in those existing services. Learning and Training Assistance Our staff provides one-on-one consultations, workshops and webinars to get you started using bioinformatics databases and tools such as: NCBI. This resource provides access to dozens of data repositories, tools and reference materials, with Pubmed being the most heavily used. We provide assistance with those NCBI resources more closely related to bioinformatics, for example: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) \u2013 Tool to find regions of similarity between nucleotide or protein sequences. Gene \u2013 Portal serving data centered around a specific gene. ClinVar \u2013 archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence MedGen \u2013 portal to information about human disorders and other phenotypes having a genetic component. Cn3D \u2013 3D viewer that displays structure, sequence, and alignment, and also includes annotation and alignment editing features. Cytoscape- An open source software used for visualizing networks of molecular interaction and biological pathways. BioCyc Database Collection- BioCyc is comprised of 14560 Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs), and tools for exploring them. It provides electronic reference sources on the pathways and genomes of many organisms. In addition to the databases on the model organisms such as yeast, fly, and mouse, BioCyc also contains databases for humans and for other eukaryotes whose PGDBs have been curated. Repbase- Repbase is a database of prototypic sequences representing repetitive DNA from different eukaryotic species. Repbase is being used in genome sequencing projects worldwide as a reference collection for masking and annotation of repetitive DNA (e.g. by RepeatMasker or CENSOR). We also support Data Visualization needs through: Data Visualization basics workshop: An overview of the What and the Why questions around visualizing data, broadly, as well as guidelines for best practices. Consultations on effectively displaying your data for publications or presentations. Research project assistance We can offer answers to basic questions on: Finding your way through databases and tools (NCBI, UCSC Genome Browser, Expression Atlas) File formats (VCF, BED, FASTA, FASTQ, BAM/SAM and associated tools) Workflows for NGS data analysis and display Platforms\u2019 usage (e.g. Galaxy, GenomeSpace) However, we can\u2019t: Clean your data Analyze your data Create figures or any other visualizations For these services, we refer you to the Bioinformatics\u2019 cores mentioned in the following tabs (pages).

BioCyc FAQs Here is a compilation of some of the most Frequently Asked Questions on BioCyc that we have received so far. Is there a way to redirect the BLAST/comparative analysis results to my email if the connection to the server gets disconnected? No Do you delete accounts once subscriptions expire? No, subscriptions and accounts are independent- especially for institutional subscriptions. SRI doesn't have any policy in this area, and they don't routinely delete accounts. At some point BioCyc will be deleting accounts that have been inactive for years. Will SmartTables that are associated to an inactive BioCyc account will eventually get removed from the list of public SmartTables? No, BioCyc will definitely retain \"published\" SmartTables, and they may retain public SmartTables as well. If I require technical assistance who should I contact? Please contact BioCyc via email at biocyc-support@ai.sri.com I have issues with logging into my BioCyc account. What should I do? A representative at SRI will forward your email regarding the login issues to Phoenix Bioinformatics- a non-profit institution that collects BioCyc subscriptions on behalf of SRI International. Is there a way to access my BioCyc account off-campus? Yes, you can access your account remotely via Franklin from Penn Libraries. You can search for \"BioCyc\" under 'databases' and click on 'Connect to full text'. You will then be prompted to enter your PennKey and from there you will be able to access the BioCyc homepage.

It constitutes the State Department's official record and provides access to previously classified material that otherwise would be unavailable. Simultaneously, its status as the official record also compromises its completeness, since it is heavily edited, with much material remaining classified. The State Department offers a description of the series What is the Foreign Relations Series? For a critical description of what criteria are used for inclusion in FRUS volumes and how political and security processes compromise their comprehensiveness see this article from The Journal of American History . It is organized by year or groups of years, with geographical or topical sub-divisions. For example, the volumes dealing with the Casablanca conference (1943) are part of the World War II group and not the year-by-year sequence. Some volumes can be quite specific, such as the two 1902 volumes called The Whaling and Sealing Claims against Russia. Particular countries interact intensively with the United States at different times, The documents in each volume are arranged chronologically. Each document has notes indicating its source and, where necessary, annotations providing contextual information or data relating the document to others. There is also a table of sources and abbreviations at the beginning of each volume, and each volume has its own detailed subject and author index. Prior to 1870, the series was published under various names. From 1870 to 1947, the uniform title Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States was used. From 1947 to 1969, the name was changed to Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers. After that date, the current name was adopted.

Japan: U.S. Naval Technical Mission, 1945-1946 The U.S. Naval Technical Mission to Japan was established on 14 August 1945.

The enterprise entailed the seizure of intelligence material, its examination, the interrogation of personnel, and ultimately the preparation of reports which would appraise the technological status of Japanese industry and the Japanese navy.

Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group Records, 1979-1981 On May 2, 1979, President Jimmy Carter and Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira met in Washington, D.C. and agreed to establish the Japan-U.S. Economic Relations Group\u2014informally known as the \"Wise Men.\" This small group of distinguished persons drawn from private life would submit recommendations to Carter and Ohira for maintaining a healthy bilateral economic relationship between the United States and Japan. Among the issues considered were the role of economic issues in the overall \"political-security-cultural relationship,\" especially Japan\u2019s emerging position as a world power; Japan\u2019s future comprehensive economic security needs; and its involvement in foreign assistance programs. The Group actively solicited the views of the American public (Congress, business, labor, agriculture, public interest groups) to provide an additional forum for those who wished to be heard. The Group also drew upon research that was currently under way in the two countries and sponsored a modest program of separate independent research. << Previous: Caribbean and Latin America Next: Europe >> Last Updated: Jun 28, 2023 8:45 AM URL: https://guides.library.upenn.edu/FRUS Print Page Login to LibApps Report a problem.
